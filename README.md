Hi, I’m @ChristianLucasGD
I’m interested in graphic design, particularly logo creation and visual branding.
I’m currently learning the Adobe Suite to enhance my design skills and explore new creative possibilities.
I’m looking to collaborate on design projects, especially those involving creative branding and innovative visual solutions.
How to reach me: luc18007@byui.edu or connect with me on LinkedIn.
Fun fact: I love playing Magic the Gathering with friends, which fuels my creativity and strategic thinking!
